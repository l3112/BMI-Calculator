# BMI-Calculator
From The Complete Javascript Course by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy
From my OneNote notes;
Comparing BMI (I guess we just make up some numbers?) 

BMI calcuations - (mass /height^2)  

 

Mass = kg, height = meter 

 

1.) Variables 

MarkMass = 

MarkHeight = 

JohnMass =  

JohnHeight = 

 

2.) calculate 

 

MarkBMI = MarkMass / (MarkHeight * MarkHeight) 

JohnBMI = JohnMass / (JohnHeight * JohnHeight) 

 

 

3.)Tried to put a boolean in a if/else statement. Ended up with both.
